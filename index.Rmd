# Adding images

Image syntax is an exclamation mark with brackets, with file name or path to file with name in parentheses (put file inside the repository). If use web link, download local version to ensure later you don't get an error if it's moved/deleted/etc.

# Navigation

set up in text file and save as _site.yaml


# Build

use to render entire website to check it all works.

# Bootswatch

this is where to get all the themes from. (obvi can also get from elsewhere, but this is all within R already). Not really worth it to learn the html you need to make your own special theme.
